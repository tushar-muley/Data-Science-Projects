As automobiles are contributor to health and global warming many of the world’s largest city are looking to limit their usage or band them from entering city centers. Enter a possible solution to getting around. New bike sharing companies are showing up in a majority of city. In the United States bike sharing program started in 2007 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The growth has been stead since and is expected to increase from $1.5 billion in 2020 to $4.4 billion by 2027.

In this case study I took data from Metro Bike’s found in Los Angeles, California. I used the data to perform Exploratory Data Analysis to better understand some key elements to bike sharing. I asked my data to provide answer to the below questions.

    1.If how ridership changes throughout the year.
    2.How do weekdays compare to weekend for bike sharing?
    3.Does having a riding membership increase bike usage compared to the casual rider?
    4.Identifying the top busiest bike stations
    5.What features influence trip count?

For my final question.

    6.Could the data be used to predict the number of trips for a station?
