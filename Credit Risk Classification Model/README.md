Lending institution have a basic need to be able to accurately determine the riskiness of the individuals applying for a loan. It is one of their biggest concerns as the margin for return is low and cost of servicing loans is high. Automation has assisted in lowering costs for servicing loans but loan losses add to the cost. All financial lending institutions want to be able to lend to as many individuals as possible. They want to see a recognized return in the form of returned principal and income as interest. The goal is to identify, which attributes better determine the riskiness of the individuals that financial organization lending money to. I am proposing we determine if more features or different features are need to predict the riskiness of the individuals before lending money to them.
